    <div class="p-2 w-100">
    <p class="text-break float-left">I have a customer service and administrative background. My latest experience involved being a frontline worker during the pandemic. In July 2020, I joined the City of Houston as a registration specialist assisting clients in getting registered for Covid-19 testing. Later, I upgraded to a specimen handler administering nasal swabs for the Houston community.
    Aside from hearing countless tragedies of death and near-death experiences from clients, the job entailed a lot of technical issues which frustrated the clients and us the workers. I began wondering about the system's backend issues. I realized I had an interest in computer science and began my studies at South Texas College in pursuit of my associate's degree.</p>

    <p>Prior to the pandemic, I barely made ends meet and the pandemic just compounded my financial struggles. I began thinking how could I enter the workforce sooner and set myself apart from my peers. Also, I knew that once I graduated from college, competition was going to be fierce. I began doing research and web development sparked my interest. I temporarily put my associate's degree on hold and and enrolled in CareerFoundry's full-stack development course. </p>

    <!-- <p>My customer background forces me to build sites with a customer-centric approach. Within the next five years, I hope to have so much knowledge in web development and connect dots. I get a thrill off of it. Also, I will be finishing college and expanding my programming skills.</p> -->

    <p> One of the most satisfying parts of web development for me has been becoming a true steward of my future. My plan includes becoming more of a leader and gain concise, creative coding skills. </p>
